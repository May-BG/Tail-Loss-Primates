# Tail-Loss-Primates
This repository contains scripts used for identifying hominoid-specific variants in genes related to tail development. 
## Overview
In order to identify variants associated with the tail loss phenotype, we conducted a comparative phylogenetic study to scan for hominoid-specific variants in 140 genes related to tail development. The full gene list is attached. Tbxt gene is used as an example for the pipeline.
